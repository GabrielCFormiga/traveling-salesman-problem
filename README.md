# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

This repository contains a heuristic solver for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) implemented in C++17 and built with the Meson Build System.

The solution approach combines the metaheuristics GRASP, ILS, and RVND.

## Constructive procedure

- [x] Randomized Greedy Construction

## Local search

- [x] RVND (Randomized Variable Neighborhood Search)

### Neighborhood

- [x] SWAP

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Meson Build System](https://mesonbuild.com/)
- C++ 17

### How to build the project

1. Setup release and debug builds:

```
meson setup build --buildtype=release
meson setup build_debug --buildtype=debug
```

2. Compile build:

```
meson compile -C <build or build_debug>
```

3. Run:

From the root directory:

```
./<build or build_debug>/src/asp <instance file path>
```
